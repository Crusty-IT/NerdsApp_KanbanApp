DEBUGGING WITH AI - COMPLETION REPORT

What Was Done:
- Bug Introduced: Changed AddScoped<IBoardService, BoardService>() to AddScoped<BoardService>();
- Error: InvalidOperationException: Body was inferred but the method does not allow inferred body parameters;
- AI Diagnosis: Used Rider AI with structured prompt. AI identified missing interface mapping in DI;
- Fix: Restored builder.Services.AddScoped<IBoardService, BoardService>();
- Verified: Endpoint works - returns 200 OK;
- Understanding: DI needs interface→implementation mapping;
