When to Use AI in Programming.
What I kearned:

AI is good at: 
- aoilerplate code, syntax, tests, explaining code;

Human is needed for: 
- architecture, security, business logic, performance;

Always verify AI output - AI can suggest insecure code!

Use AI to learn, not to avoid learning!


My tasks analysis below.
a) BoardService:

AI did well: interface structure, EF syntax, naming conventions;
I had to fix: DI registration, verify business logic;
Conclusion: AI = fast skeleton, human = context & validation;

Debugging:

AI did well: found DI bug quickly, explained the fix;
I had to fix: I have to understand a fix;
Conclusion: DI needs AddScoped<Interface, implementation;

USE AI for:

- syntax I forgot;
- test generation;
- explaining legacy code;

Do not use AI for:

- architecture app decisions;
- business logic;
- security code;
- performance optimization;
